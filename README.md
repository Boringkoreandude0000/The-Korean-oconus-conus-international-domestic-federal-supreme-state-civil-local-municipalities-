Information regarding clandestine, unlicensed, or unauthorized radio operations, along with related frequencies, call signs, and station data, is managed by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and is frequently subject to Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests. 
FCC Enforcement and Unlicensed Operations
Pirate Radio Crackdown: The FCC prioritizes identifying and taking action against "pirate" or unauthorized radio operators who use frequencies assigned to legitimate stations, causing interference.
Reporting Unlicensed Stations: Complaints about unauthorized operations can be filed through the FCC’s Consumer Complaint Center by selecting "pirate/unauthorized operation".
Information to Provide: To assist in identification, reports should include the city/state, frequency, call sign (if used), and times of operation.
Penalties: Under the PIRATE Act, the FCC can issue fines of up to $119,555 per day, with a maximum of over $2.3 million. 
FOIA and Document Releases
CIA Records: The CIA Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) Electronic Reading Room contains declassified documents on radio station identification, electronic facilities in other countries (e.g., Cuba), and signals service reports.
Requesting Records: FOIA allows for the release of records, subject to nine exemptions that protect national security, law enforcement interests, and personal privacy.
FCC Database: The FCC maintains public databases (LMS) for authorized station information, including ownership reports, construction permits, and call sign histories. 
Technical and Regulatory Context
Station Identification: Authorized stations must identify themselves hourly, typically using their assigned call sign and community of license.
Unauthorized Frequencies: ISM bands (902-928 MHz, 2.400-2.4835 GHz, 5.725-5.875 GHz) are used for unlicensed wireless equipment.
Military/Emergency Frequencies: Specific frequencies, such as 40.5 MHz, are designated as joint common frequencies for emergency and rescue communications.
Traffic Analysis: Techniques such as using codes, ciphers, and disguised call signs are analyzed by traffic analysts to reconstruct communication networks, according to historical NSA documentation.
